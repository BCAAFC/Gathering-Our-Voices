  ## Culture, Opportunity and Inspiration

  **We are honoured to host Gathering Our Voices National Aboriginal Youth
  Conference on the territory of Westbank First Nations.**

  From March 21 - 24, 2017 GOV will bring together more than 1000 Indigenous youth delegates
  as well as chaperones, presenters and guests to Kelowna, BC. Young
  people from all across Canada are invited to join us to
  explore, to learn and to engage with our culture among peers.
  This yearâ€™s conference is rooted in culture.


  Youth, chaperones, presenters, exhibitors, Elders, volunteers and
  other guests will have the opportunity to make new connections,
  rekindle old bonds, engage their passions and discover a new drive.
  How can we improve the present? How can we create a brighter future
  for ourselves? Are we prepared to face the upcoming challenges?


  Join us and learn from pillars of our community, hear their stories, their
  struggles, and their triumphs. Then, forge your own way by creating your own
  special blend of workshops, it is your choice what you learn, just as it is your
  future. Spend your evenings participating in our live Talent Showcase and
  dance party. Finally, reconnect to your roots during our cultural morning and
  closing ceremonies.

  ## A Glimpse Of The Past

  The BCAAFC has previously hosted fourteen Aboriginal Youth
  Conferences. Youth delegates and chaperones from all over
  the country travel at their own expense to attend these
  conferences. The purpose of these conferences is to unite youth
  throughout the country in learning, healing and sharing and to
  provide tangible tools, resources and knowledge that
  the youth can bring back to their communities.


  The first two conferences hosted over 100 youth attendees, while the third saw
  attendance triple to over 460 youth delegates. The fourth and fifth conferences
  doubled attendance to over 800 youth. The 2008 Conference in Victoria had
  nearly 1000 people in attendance; the 2009 Conference in Kelowna had 1300
  people attend; the 2010 Conference in Vancouver and the 2011 Conference in
  Prince Rupert, over 1500 people took part, in Nanaimo (2012) over 1600 people
  gathered together, in Penticton (2013) more than 2000 people participated, and
  Vancouver (2014) saw more than 2200 participants. In Prince George (2015) the
  conference reached capacity months before the event started. Last year in Victoria
  we reached 2000 registered delegates, even before early registration had closed.
  This overwhelming response serves to reinforce the need for a forum where
  Indigenous youth can come together to begin to make positive changes in their
  own lives and in their communities.
