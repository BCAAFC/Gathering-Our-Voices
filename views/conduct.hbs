  ## You are a Representative of your Community
  Your personal conduct, both in and out of the conference, reflects upon your community and it is your responsibility to safeguard the reputation and pride of all Indigenous people.

  ## It’s a Matter of Respect
  You are a guest and you can go a long way towards assuring yourself and the other delegates a warm and memorable welcome through a simple show of respect.
  * Respect for all the participants of the conference.
  * Respect for the social/cultural values of youth from other communities.
  * Respect for regulations and standards set down by the organizing body and host community.
  * Respect for people of the host organization (staff, volunteers, guests, presenters, service personnel).


  ## Curfew
  We ask that ALL participants and chaperones respect the conference curfew of 11:30 p.m. Participants are asked to be at their accommodations by the curfew time.

  ## Recreational Activities

  In recreational activities, participants will represent their community with dignity, personal integrity, and spirit of good sportsmanship and fair play.    Please bring proper clothing and shoes; personal equipment is optional.

  ## Chaperone(s)
  There must be one chaperone for every five participants ages 14 to 17 years and he/she is:
  * 21 years of age or older.
  * Responsible for the safety, welfare and conduct of their youth AT ALL TIMES.
  * Expected to be a positive role model and set positive examples to ALL YOUTH.
  * Expected to assist youth in locating workshops, arriving in a timely manner and ensure youth remain in their workshops until the session is complete.
