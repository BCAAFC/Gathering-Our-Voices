  Gathering Our Voices is a youth conference designed to give youth the tools to work towards a better tomorrow by improving themselves and the world. The event is hosted by the BC Association of Aboriginal Friendship Centres, and is guided by the BCAAFC’s Provincial Aboriginal Youth Council. Over the past 14 years the conference has seen great success with the over 20,000 youth who have attended.
Gathering Our Voices 2017 will be held at the Delta Grand Okanagan Resort and Conference Centre in Kelowna, B.C., on the traditional territory of the Westbank First Nations. Over the course of four days, over 1,000 delegates from across Canada will gather to conduct ceremonies and host over 60 workshops, offering exciting ways to engage, inform, educate, entertain and inspire the youth.
Gathering Our Voices brings with it many opportunities for us to share the stage with likeminded partners wishing to engage with youth and contribute to the improved lives of Indigenous people throughout B.C. The BCAAFC will work to find a program that fits your investment priorities and organizational values. 

Gathering  Our  Voices  takes  place  in  a  different  community  each  year 
to allow for greater access by youth around the province. In 2017, the 
conference  will  be  hosted  at  the  Delta  Grand  Okanagan  Resort  and 
Conference Centre in Kelowna, BC. Over the course of four days we will

  # Investment Opportunities: Branding and Presentation Partners

  The success of the event has brought with it many opportunities for us to share 
the stage with likeminded partners wishing to engage with youth and 
contribute to the improved lives of Indigenous people throughout BC and 
Canada. 
Gathering Our Voices Aboriginal Youth Conference is an important event with 
opportunities for your organization to invest in Indigenous youth. The BCAAFC 
will work to find a program that fits your investment priorities and 
organizational values. We will also extend invitations to your organization to 
attend events and share in the celebration. 
These youth are not only our future, they are our now. Young leaders, 
academics, and change makers stand with talented, hard workers, and 
ambitious thinkers. Our youth are amazing; we have to tell them.

  ## $5,000/$50,000 Meal Support Presented by...

  In Indigenous culture any gatherings or celebrations would not be complete 
without the serving of food and GOV is the epitome of gathering and 
celebrating. Traditionally, food was a part of doing business, of taking care of 
those in our community who have traveled away from home. It is more than 
sustenance, it is a tool to make everyone feel a part of a gathering and make 
them comfortable. Meal service varies from GOV location to location. Where 
possible we will include social enteprise/social purpose catering companies 
and support local businesses through our event venues.

Generally, meals include one dinner, two breakfasts, and two lunches. Up to 
ten meal support sponsors will be included at $5000 each or exclusively can be 
arranged for a $50,000 investment. All meal support sponsors will be 
recognized with signage at all food service venues. All logos will appear with 
the quote “Gathering Our Voices would like to thank the following 
organizations for their support of our meal program.” Please provide your logo 
in colour and black and white 7 days in advance of GOV to ensure inclusion.

  * 1 ticket to Closing Ceremonies for each $5,000 investment

  ## $7,500 Volunteer Program Presented by...

offered by this team of committed community volunteers. This year we 
will recruit 200 volunteers to work with our staff to deliver the many 
aspects of GOV.

  Twenty-five staff and as many as 100 volunteers will be graciously 
acknowledged at events following GOV. Although we express our gratitude at 
the Closing Ceremonies, along with the audience of grateful youth, we have 
found it profoundly important to share a meal with these groups to debrief 
from a hard week of service to our youth. Stories of the impact of this work 
we have done together, observations of how procedures can be improved, 
ideas for new activities can all be shared informally over a meal.

This sponsor of these events will be given the opportunity to make remarks at 
the appreciation events; signage, preferably retractable banner, provided by 
the sponsor will be displayed at the entrance to the events.

celebration with a victory song or peace song to send the honoured youth 
back to the conference to join the masses feeling stonger and closer than ever 
before.

  ## $250,000+ Conference Co-Host

  There is no greater gift that can be given than to be told that you have 
made a difference in a young person’s life. To hear joy as youth recount 
their week, to see a smile that you know won’t leave anytime soon and to 
be there for requests for autographs and the exchange of hugs and 
high-fives. It all seems to simple, host a conference that have thousands of 
people attend, but the impact is nearly immeasurable. 

We know for some youth this event is the highlight of their year. For others 
it is a turning point in their career or academic journey. There are a few 
precious moments where life is chosen over suicide. We don’t talk about it 
often, but we know we are profoundly impacting people’s lives. 
It is for all these reasons we value the Gathering Our Voices Co-Host in the 
highest regard. 

As a Conference Co-Host your logo will appear on the delegate t-shirts of 
1,000+ youth , 200-300 chaperones, 100+ volunteers, and 50+ volunteer 
security. Your logo will also appear on all documents and forms, anywhere 
the BCAAFC and host Friendship Centre logo appears (from the time of your 
investment forward, we cannot reprint documents or forms). 

Signage provided by the Co-Host will be placed at focal points at every GOV 
event next to the BCAAFC signage. Preference is for retractable banners. 
Co-branded banners may also be produced with approval by the Co-hosting 
partner. 

MC’s will publically acknowledge the Co-Host everytime the BCAAFC is 
acknowledged. This will take place at every GOV event including: Opening 
and Closing Ceremonies, Honouring Feast, Youth Talent Showcase, Dance, 
and Cultural Morning.

  * Up to 8 tickets to the Opening Ceremonies & Closing Ceremonies
  * 8 tickets to any other GOV programmed event
  * Direct or deliver a facilitated workshop for youth attending GOV
