Gathering Our Voices 2017 
Reaches Capacity in One Week

Victoria, B.C. – The 15th Annual Gathering Our Voices (GOV) National Indigenous Youth Conference sold out within a week.  Registration for GOV 2017 went live Monday, September 26th   and half the spaces were filled within the first 24 hours. All 1200 seats are taken for the March 2017 event in Kelowna, co-hosted by Ki-Low-Na Friendship Society.

Leslie Varley, Executive Director of BCAAFC, the co-hosting agency, commented, “This level of commitment to the GOV 2017 reflects the increasing need for opportunities that positively reinforce Indigenous youth identity.  We make every effort to accommodate as many youth as possible each year.”

Community groups work hard year round to fundraise for their youth to attend GOV.  Last year’s event was held in Victoria BC, and included a Totem Pole raising, the Premier’s Awards for Aboriginal Youth Excellence in Sport and the Nike N7 Move Moment. 

Youth take in a selection of workshops including health, self esteem development, anti-violence, physical activity, education and career planning. Each year the youth outdo themselves with an entertaining evening of world class talent. 

There remain opportunities for corporate sponsorship, and event volunteers. For further information please contact Della Preston at 250-388-5522 Ext. 210 or email govcoordinator@bcaafc.com.
