<h1>Privay Policy</h1>
<h4>Data Transmission</h4>
<p>This website uses secure SSL encryption to ensure that your data is not inspected "on the wire" by malicious attackers. Do note that, as with all encryption, this precaution does not ensure your data's safety against national spy agencies. Also note that the security precautions taken will be vulnerable to being stored and decrypted in the future when it is economical to do so.</p>

<h4>Data Storage</h4>
<p>Your personal information is stored on a secure private server hosted by the Funtoo Linux project in the United States. The BCAAFC also stores daily backups of the databases in case of failure. Your data (except your password) is not stored encrypted as this would have a dramatic impact on performance, while not increasing security enough to warrant it.</p>
<p>Your password is stored using a 10-pass bcrypt algorithm in order to ensure that even in the event of a security breach your other accounts will remain secure.</p>

<h4>Personal Information</h4>
<p>Any information you submit as part of your registration will be accessible to the Gathering Our Voices conference coordinator and assistant coordinator(s). This information will be used for the express purposes of conference planning and organisation, and to ensure the safety of all delegates, volunteers, and staff. We do not distribute this data externally under any circumstances without your permission. Your provided email address and/or phone numbers may be used to contact you by the Gathering Our Voices conference team.</p>

<h4>Third Parties</h4>
<p>The BCAAFC conference team may disclose your name, age, gender, medical information, and emergency contact information to health professionals and cooking staff (in the case of food allergies) at the convention. This will be to ensure the readiness of the health and safety teams in the event of a medical emergency.</p>

<h4>Internal Stat Tracking</h4>
<p>We maintain a private, root-accessible log of all requests and responses coming and going from the website for the security of your data and our infrastructure. This data is periodically purged and may be used to derive anonymous, conference level statistics about usage.</p>

<h4>Digital Archives</h4>
<p>At the end of the conference all delegate information is moved to a digital archive to help next yearâ€™s conference team anticipate the needs of future delegates. This allows the Gathering Our Voices conference coordinator to organize facilities, meals, workshops, and other resources with greater accuracy and efficiency.</p>

<h4>BC Association of Aboriginal Friendship Centres</h4>
<p>The Gathering Our Voices conference team is hosted by the BC Association of Aboriginal Friendship Centres. Located in Victoria, British Columbia, the BCAAFC provides administrative, logistical, and technical support to the GOV conference team. All BCAAFC employees are bound by a strict confidentiality policy regarding the protection and distribution of anonymous and personal data.</p>

<p>This policy may be amended in the future.</p>
