  ## A Glimpse Of The Past

  The BCAAFC has previously hosted thirteen Aboriginal Youth
  Conferences. Youth delegates and chaperones from all over
  the country travel at their own expense to attend these
  conferences. The purpose of these conferences is to unite youth
  throughout the country in learning, healing and sharing and to
  provide tangible experiences of tools, resources and knowledge that
  the youth can bring back to their communities.


  The first two conferences hosted over 100 youth attendees, while the third saw
  attendance triple to over 460 youth delegates. The fourth and fifth conferences
  doubled attendance to over 800 youth. The 2008 Conference in Victoria had
  nearly 1000 people in attendance; the 2009 Conference in Kelowna had 1300
  people attend; the 2010 Conference in Vancouver and the 2011 Conference in
  Prince Rupert, over 1500 people took part, in Nanaimo (2012) over 1600 people
  gathered together, in Penticton (2013) more than 2000 people participated, and
  Vancouver (2014) saw more than 2200 participants. In Prince George (2015) the
  conference reached capacity months before the event started. This
  overwhelming response serves to reinforce the need for a forum where
  Aboriginal youth can come together to begin to make positive changes in their
  own lives and in their communities.
