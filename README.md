# Gathering Our Voices #

Welcome, this is the whole source for the GOV 2016 Website.

## Why this site? ##

The [BCAAFC](http://www.bcaafc.com/) needed a clean, simple, user friendly event management software for the Gathering Our Voices Youth Conference.

It was decided at the start of the project, back in September 2012 to develop the project in the open, encouraging people to utilize our techniques for dealing with troubles, as well as letting them inspect how it works.

## What does it use? ##

This website is written entirely in Javascript, Handlebars (a templating language), and CSS. It uses the Postgres database to store attendee data.

## How to Use ##

* Git clone
* `grunt build`
* `npm start`

## How to Deploy ##

`// TODO`

## Contributors ##

Our heroic Youth Conference Coordinator, Della Preston, has helped immensely with development efforts, her time, insights, and constant critical eye have helped drive the quality of the product from beginning to start. Though she has not contributed code her specifications and knowledge of the event have touched virtually every part of the codebase.

The lead developer, Andrew Hobden ([@Hoverbear](https://github.com/Hoverbear/)), is a dedicated believer in the Free/Open-Source software movement.
